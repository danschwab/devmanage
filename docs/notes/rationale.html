    <h2>Rationale:</h2>
    <p>
        Top Shelf Exhibits currently has no consolidated inventory tracking whatsoever. This system would be an in-house solution that unifies several inventory touchpoints that are currently disconnected.
    </p>
    <h2>Possibilities:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate initial pack lists directly from Inventor models as early as concept stage</li>
        <li>Identify item shortages as pack lists are generated (including beMatrix items if added)</li>
        <li>Enable tracking of item conditions and improve efficiency of repair schedule</li>
        <li>Provide historical data analysis to improve busy season planning</li>
        <li>Quick inventory or item history checks and updates via qrcode scanning</li>
        <li>Easy cost tracking, pricing, and budgeting analytics if internal pricing fields are added</li>
        <li>Mobile-friendly for on-the-go inventory management and status checks</li>
    </ul>
