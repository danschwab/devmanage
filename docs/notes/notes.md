## TopShelf Live Inventory Notes

Deployment Notes

- Allow and request email feedback from users
- Bundle changes into updates, carefully log changes made, and send out a release email before making the updates
- Make sure any changes to user data or database structure are backwards compatible or allow users to migrate on first use

System Notes

- whenever possible, rely on the caching system instead of data from live tables.
- Google drive rate-limits queries, making it difficult to realtime-check tons of stuff -> this impacts the ability to open multiple tabs at once
- We must always query the inventory by date for analytics, but we must never pass the date into a reactiveStore save or load call. This causes auto-save mismatch, etc.

## Usage

Intended Use Cases:

- We can have pack lists generated from Inventor
- We can know if there are item shortages as pack lists are generated
- If we add bematrix stuff to pack lists, we can also check inventory qty of them
  x If we auto generate packlists from concept models, we can get an early alert of possible inventory issues as those shows are approved (needs approval system)
- We can get an inventory report of item quantities throughout the year
- All of our data is available and easy to update on the go
- We can migrate all our checklists and schedule management to this system

Current Usage:

- software being used for inventory... slowly. Ben is updating the inventory a bit at a time.
- being used to identify shortages when doublechecking packlist info.
- being used to verify packlists by going to the packlist tab and cross-referencing data with his manual packlist

Ongoing User Conversations:

- there is a lot of data that does not get on our packlist, mostly consumables and client stuff.
  Example of lightbox additions:
  lightbox
  backliner for
  base plates
  lb graphic
  tv supports
  box buildout for tv
- Nomenclature (!!!TALK ABOUT THIS SOON!!!)
  TTOP/TBASE/TV/AV numbering
  SHLF vs SHELF, CNTR vs COUNTER, CAB vs CABINET, etc
- automation rules (MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW... per conversation w ben)
  Rules: Typical Client Items, Tools and Supplies, Tech Accessories
  auto add new rows at end of packlist (client items, tools, etc)
  add a row following an item for typical inclusions (carpet + pad, monitor + cabling, etc)
- Crating from Ben:
  add and configure default crate types??? but ben often goes back and changes multiple times! (Maybe not now)
  coffin crate 10' pile in, (sometimes furniture?)
  some things have designated crates, some more than one config of crate and are split out on occasion, or split out when less than crate is sent
  often if sending one, we will send on a skid
- doubles, As and Bs, and variant tracking
  should we keep them as separate items knowing they won't inventory check? Or should we consolidate them and just track overall quantity?
  A variant tracking system would allow for better tracking (NOT NOW per conversation w ben)
  (electronics with serial numbers, passwords, locations)
- Inventory Handling:
  Standard: FURNITURE, CABINETS, HANGING SIGNS, COUNTERTOPS, SHELVES, LIGHTBOXES, LIGHTING
  Special logic to support finding items: HARDWARE
  !!! In standard descriptions: Power strips? Cables? Keyboards and mice? Remotes? Antennas?
  Consolidated tracked: BEAMATRIX PANELS & HARDWARE
  (?) Extra tracking: ELECTRONICS, MONITORS
  (?) Monitor arms? Remotes and power strips?
  Will come in uninventoried: Client or new items shown in booth, Decorative Items

## TO DO

**chores**

- [ ] ! bring more clarity to the advanced filter, and potentially unify with api filtering. (fix the weird options available in views that don't support them)
- [ ] ! "views" for tables and reports allowing column customization
- [ ] basic schedule table needs to have return and show date columns visible
- [ ] basic schedule table needs to allow wide table
- [ ] test no internet mode
- [ ] I have not tested what happens if two users simultaniously trigger inventory upcoming change resolution
      reports column headers percentage based and dynamically abbreviate
      unify the styling of cards and buttons
      change style system so that color variables are set via classes on components, and those variables set the "--color-\*" variables per component instead of globally.
      clickable and highlightable (can copy contents) table cells instead of cell buttons
      allow modals to receive the arrow keys and enter button

**problems**

- [ ] ! mobile view some things don't show well (arrows, button sizes for transshipments)
- [ ] some sticky headers too high on mobile after page switch, dashboard nav issue
- [ ] thumbnails slow on chromium
- [ ] autosave backup is currently broken, probably because of failure to identify user tab or backup entries correctly
- [ ] packlist print from dashboard will not print correctly if not on packlist page first
- [ ] it's possible for multiple api requests to be reporting progress simultaniously and do odd things to api progress tracking
- [ ] some clicks doubleclick (opening sched details for the first time, some other things that I can't remember)
- [ ] refreshing packlists leaves undo history in odd state.

**Application tasks**

inventory updates

- [ ] run configured upcoming inventory shortage report automatically on main inventory page and show warnings in items and categories
- [ ] dims at the beginning of item descriptions for all items
- [?] ensure inventory table generation is unified so changes propegate throughout components and reports correctly
- [ ] add all FURNITURE, LIGHTING, Puck hardware
      allow attaching a change dates to a project??? for instance, if we are selling a chair to a client, or if a chair broke at a show, or we are aquiring a chair for a show
      item status interface to locate items and update item status
      We could integrate a repair schedule and other things into this system for a complete inventory management system
      allow assigning and tracking items with unique ids. ex: cradlepoint routers with individual serial numbers, passwords, and location info attached in inventory and tracked separately
      track crate information to further streamline pack list generation (Crate UI similar to packlists? Allow Ben to manage crates, and analysis search/suggest typical crates when editing a packlist?)

Architecture Improvements

- [ ] !!! better "Find..." tools for nonfiltered searching with up/down navigation and a "selected" found item index, probably just a numberbox attached to the find box and some javascript to autoset this by nearest match or something, and url searchterm updating perhaps
- [ ] !!! history and last edit viewing tools: Provide tools to revert changes from history (steal from inventory upcoming changes ui), and tools to revert based on source,history modification utility for viewing changes over time and changing their values if necessary? Inventory specific future changes updating?
- [ ] ! test and validate offline mode
- [ ] charts?
      allow auto-caching of analytics data
      save deleted information in a special table for recovery if necessary
      allow analysis to intelligently slow or pause itself and notify user for slow connection states.
      improve dashboard endpoints to allow multiple cards with different view parameters?

show management system

- [ ] !!!!! run configured upcoming inventory shortage report automatically on schedule page and show warnings in items and categories: This needs to not explode computers. May need analysis caching first.
- [ ] !!!! add "views" system to show different columns and layouts for different purposes
- [ ] !!! design queue and updating logic <- views system to support this as a schedule view
- [ ] !! alert me about projects that don't yet have files attached to them
- [ ] advanced search add and configure boolean flag columns (shown as checkboxes) and filter option
- [ ] calendar view improvements: allow views showing ship/return, maybe allow schedule overlays on other pages for context
- [ ] alerts for new construction?
      add workzone info to table???
      allow sorting, categorization (viewable/hidden in certain domains), and organization of saved searches
      allow user to access show searches as pages and pin to dashboard
      analyze and show the rough number and complexity of shows throughout the year and provide work estimate reporting

Pack Lists in Web

- [ ] !!! packlist item approval checklist and packlist edit vs. item-approval mode (Add item to existing or new crate, remove, group, etc)
- [ ] !!! Item Action Bubble Improvements: add "add to new crate", "move to existing crate", "move rows"
- [ ] !!! improve viewing and editing and alert configuration based on current use-case
- [ ] ! enable actions bubbles for crates selections
- [ ] ! automations interface, packlist rules: allow user to configure automations, automatic packlist rule suggestion jobs run in the background (Ex: description change recommendations for common or similar items that checks or aggregates history, allow for quick addition of typical client or show items)
- [ ] store and display source and viewing data, allow clearing (approve incoming changes) for cad additions/changes?
- [ ] support for "concept packlist" that has a partial packlist with some things already filled in, but clearly labeled as concept model export
      show icons for all items in the packlist
      create a more advanced filtering component for tables that includes multi-select, ranges, and text search and integrates with urlparams similar to the advanced search select
      allow adding items to inventory through packlist via simple interface (use item as description, extract quantity if exists, user choose category, auto add and save)

dropbox / workzone / sql integrations

      allow opening link to dropbox or workzone pdfs
      identify and show versions/dates of output files
      microsoft server or google workspace integration?
      dropbox service account and auth sync

checklist, reports, and notes system

      create and edit checklists
      template checklists
      complete checklists
      link checklists to products
      allow template checklist linking to product areas: packlists, inventories, shows
      allow template checklists to be applied based on triggers
      allow logical checklist creation from data (ex: packlist items checklist)
      integrate with notifications
      integrate with automations
