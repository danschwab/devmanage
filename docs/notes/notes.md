## NOTES

whenever possible, rely on the caching system instead of data from live tables.
Google oAuth2 for client-only apps requires a token refresh every hour, no exceptions
Google drive rate-limits queries, making it difficult to realtime-check tons of stuff -> this impacts the ability to open multiple tabs at once
We can potentially save Dropbox service account keys in google drive and use them to access our dropbox files without user auth. This risks key exposure.

Inventory Handling:
Standard: FURNITURE, CABINETS, HANGING SIGNS, COUNTERTOPS, SHELVES, LIGHTBOXES, LIGHTING
Special logic to support finding items: HARDWARE
In standard descriptions: Power strips? Cables? Keyboards and mice? Remotes? Antennas?
Consolidated tracked: BEAMATRIX PANELS & HARDWARE
Extra tracking: ELECTRONICS, MONITORS
Will come in uninventoried: Client or new items shown in booth, Decorative Items
Rules: Typical Client Items, Tools and Supplies, Tech Accessories
?: Monitor arms? Remotes and power strips?

Need features:

- add new rows at end of packlist (client items, tools, etc)
- add a row following an item for typical inclusions (carpet + pad, monitor + cabling, etc)
- consolidate, but still track items (beMatrix panels and hardware)
- track unique items (electronics with serial numbers, passwords, locations)

For design and project queue:

- checklists for each item? Define checklists for items somehow? Checklists with username requirements? User table? Checklists with linked data entry fields?
- show what pdfs are exported for each project
- nebulus project stages, base on current system: projects are requested, updated, communicated via email. Put all information in one place, but allow tags and filters? Or force update notes to be connected to a category or checklist?
- if certain documents exist, they are assumed correct - force approvals? Assume approvals for certain types of projects? Allow document approvals to be revoked? Approvals are just checklists?
- checklists need to have the ability to link to styles in schedule views. We have advanced search, maybe add "Advanced Views" that allows custom columns, column styling based on rules, etc? Should this be hardcoded?
- allow calendar view of shows. Allow drag and drop scheduling for show dates and ship/ret date thresholds? Maybe the interface should allow "card view", "table view", and "calendar view" for things? Hard code, or option for user?
- Notifications system? Integrate emails? Allow checkbox or defaults for recipients? Default text? Allow templates? Should the system allow changes via email replies?

## Primary Use Cases

- [50%] We can have pack lists generated from Inventor
- [95%] We can know if there are item shortages as pack lists are generated
- [80%] If we add bematrix stuff to pack lists, we can also check inventory qty of them
- [ 0%] If we auto generate packlists from concept models, we can get an early alert of possible inventory issues as those shows are approved
- [ 0%] We can get an inventory report of item quantities throughout the year
- [ 0%] We can migrate all our checklists and schedule management to this system
- [10%] All of our data is available and easy to update on the go

## TO DO

**chores**

      make the calls to user data automatically cancel and show a screen alert if the user hasnt given permissions.

- [x] Inject the sheet ids and the api-key via github soas not to expose them
- [ ] remove hamburger buttons that do nothing
- [x] packlist print titleblock??
- [x] add context variables to live site github
- [?] refresh buttons should clear caches
- [ ] fix packlist table header alignment
- [x] simplify and impliment more url filling and parameter saving in nav and back buttons (for instance breadcrumb nav should cache some url params)
- [ ] tableComponent finder needs: a clear all button, and a hide rows toggle
- [ ] make table headers accessible when scrolling
- [ ] reports column headers percentage based and dynamically abbreviate
- [ ] basic schedule table needs to have return and show date columns visible
- [ ] basic schedule table needs to allow wide table
- [ ] packlist interface somehow show "was previously" during edits

**problems**

- [ ] packlist print from dashboard will not print correctly if not on packlist page first
- [ ] redundancy and overcomplexity in navigation still must be reduced
- [ ] canceled due to newer identical call shouldn't cancel but should pass the promise around to avoid failed analysis
- [ ] fix duplication of bematrix VELCRO PANELS
- [ ] fix 45 degree curved panels
- [ ] navigation is not clearing prompt variable when the user selects logout or clicks out of the modal
- [ ] make navigation modal not allow exit
- [ ] fix thumbnails again: make the analysis step invalidation ignore repeat invalidations: analysis invalidation reruns need to have a delay timer built in that gets pushed out, and cancelled if main data invalidates, and don't listen for analysis invalidation during main data load
- [ ] error causing unsyncing of packlist saves, especially when data or rows are deleted
- [x] clicking primary nav in desktop view should always nav to base page instead of doing so only every other click
- [x] buttons dont work on reports
- [x] changing url doesnt immidiately update saved search
- [x] container path update in packlistTable accidentally redirects the dashboard to the path as well. Fix this by making the edit endpoint not be a path location, but be a table mode instead.
- [x] error causing early dashboard changes to be overwritten by an empty dashboard
- [x] error causing card component to lose analytics details on reload after cache clear???
- [t] ensure log out/in does not break things: the pin button currently breaks on reauth (was test data missing email on reauth...)
- [x] error causing logout to not clean up all data and cause errors on reauth (username set to "User" instead of actual username)
- [x] New or empty packlists have the wrong headers: fix hardcoded templating and row showing errors
- [x] scrolling issue when navigating
- [t] error causing imperfect or corrupted analytics information on data refresh after auth
- [x] github deployment needs to be rerun every time due to config.js build issues? (need to set up deployment via actions in github settings)
- [?] waiting too long before reauthentication breaks requests and components get locked up in loading state with incorrect or empty reactiveStore data

**Application tasks**

dropbox integration

- [ ] dropbox service account and auth sync
- [ ] identify and show versions/dates of output files
- [ ] allow opening link to dropbox pdfs
- [ ] migrate thumbnails to dropbox and allow uploading new thumbnails to dropbox

inventory updates

- [x] include all current categories
- [x] Improve inventory item finding: match actual bematrix hardware to inventory bematrix item numbers
- [x] allow editing of item quantities
- [x] allow editing of item descriptions
- [ ] allow adding new items
- [x] add existing item thumbnails
- [ ] track crate information to further streamline pack list generation
- [x] make thumbnails be a cached analytics step
- [ ] add all FURNITURE
- [ ] update LIGHTBOXES
- [ ] add all LIGHTING
      optimize thumbnail finding: cached call that gets thumbnail folder contents once
      allow uploading new item thumbnails
      allow assigning and tracking items with unique ids. ex: cradlepoint routers with individual serial numbers, passwords, and location info attached in inventory and tracked separately
      item status interface to locate items and update item status

Architecture Improvements

- [ ] log out needs to skip database operations if the token is already expired
- [ ] improve error handling and user notifications for failed auth and failed permissions
- [x] dashboard configuration
- [x] user preferences storage
- [ ] locking and edit rules to prevent simultaneous edits: 'is editing' flag for packlists and inventories that locks other users out.
      consider always checking the edithistory last-edited date before saving to prevent overwriting simultaneous changes?
- [x] ReactiveStore periodically save data to spreadsheet, and check + load data from spreadsheet to prevent data loss on accidental tab close or crash. Notify user "recovered unsaved changes..."
- [x] extra spreadsheet EditHistory column
- [ ] impliment edithistory for packlists (complete for inventory, not complete for multilayer packlist data)
- [x] save history: dateTime, userName, fields edited & old values
- [ ] save deleted information in a special table for recovery if necessary
- [ ] Provide tools to revert changes from history
- [ ] allow autocaching of analytics data
- [x] reactiveStore efficiency: stack, prioritize, and batch api calls from reactiveStores to ensure application data is available first without hitting rate limits
      allow unused reactiveStores to self-clean to save memory after a period of inactivity
      remove cache timeout for database access and allow these caches to work as offline functionality, saving in longterm storage and pushing if necessary when reconnected

HIGH PRIORITY: Export Basic Pack List from Inventor

- [x] Create new pack list in Google Sheets
- [x] Input items into Google Sheets

- [ ] change the packlist export to export all items correctly
- [ ] fix CABINET item numbers in inventor
- [ ] fix FURNITURE item numbers in inventor
- [ ] fix HANGING SIGN item numbers in inventor
- [x] make sure panel and hardware part numbers come in correctly
- [x] when consolidating HARDWARE if the vendor literally is "HARDWARE" don't set the part number to that
- [ ] verify panel and hardware and other possible edge-cases
- [ ] Improve and test this system
      Categorize all booth parts according to Pack List Rules (preferences)

- [ ] allow new packlists from template, allow duplicate packlists from existing packlists (add to main packlist page, and as an action on a packlist)
- [ ] !!! automations interface, packlist rules
- [ ] allow user to configure automations
- [ ] automatic packlist rule suggestion jobs run in the background?
- [ ] description change recommendations for common or similar items that checks or aggregates history potentially?
- [ ] automations automatically allow for quick addition of typical client or show items
      create a more advanced filtering component for tables that includes multi-select, ranges, and text search and integrates with urlparams similar to the advanced search select
      allow adding items to inventory through packlist via simple interface (use item as description, extract quantity if exists, user choose category, auto add and save)

show management system

- [x] link shows to pack lists
- [x] advanced search and preset system
- [ ] interface to allow "overlap" vs "show date" options for advanced search
- [ ] allow text field omission in advanced search (ex: return results that do not have a certain client name, or location, etc)

      link to quick reports from other locations (ex: advanced-search, or from inventory for upcoming shows, or from packlist details, etc)

**maybe**
change style system so that color variables are set via classes on components, and those variables set the "--color-\*" variables per component instead of globally.
quick action buttons on cards?
allow analysis to intelligently slow or pause itself and notify user for slow connection states.
implement notes and checklists
workspace system with multiple dashboards?
allow modals to receive the arrow keys and enter button
create backup of packlists before saving packlist to ensure no data loss
find missing show or client index info and allow user to add it
user preferences (allow delay save)

- view table details in modal or as dropdown default
- default settings for primary page views
